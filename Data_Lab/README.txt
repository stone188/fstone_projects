Graph 1.0.0

Simple visual implementation of a graph using adjacency 
matrix. Simply follow instructions in prompt to proceed.
Dijkstra table is read as follows:
	1(strating node)	0
	2(node)			4(shortest path from start to node)
	3(node)			6(shortest path from start to node)
	4(node)			8(shortest path from start to node)

Please note that Primm's nor Kruskal's algorithm is implemented
due to the fact that this is a directed graph. Also note that I
ran out of time to add comments to my code.
